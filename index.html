        <article><h1>WordPress Gutenberg Blocks for NHS Theme</h1>
<p>This repository houses the native Gutenberg blocks for the Nightingale WordPress theme from NHS Leadership Academy.
This is a standalone plugin, but is intended to be used in concert with the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/nightingale">Nightingale</a> theme. The plugin and theme together complete the WordPress deployment of the NHSUK Frontend design.</p>
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>This plugin requires minimum Wordpress 5.0</p>
<p>If you are running the Gutenberg plugin as a separate entity (Gutenberg is built in to the core of WordPress - this
ONLY applies if you also have the plugin) then the NHSBlocks plugin may have some unexpected behaviour. The
NHSBlocks plugin is built to use the core version of Gutenberg included in WordPress.</p>
<p>Whilst designed for the Nightingale WordPress theme, this plugin is a standalone and has its own css included, so
can be included to any WordPress site meeting the minimum requirements above. If you ARE running the Nightingale
theme, the plugin stylesheets will be supressed and the the theme stylesheet will cover everyting so there will be
no duplication of css.</p>
<h2>Deployment Instructions</h2>
<p>Download the <code>nhsblocks.zip</code> from this repository. Install this to your wordpress via admin &gt; plugins &gt; add new &gt; upload. Go to your wordpress admin,
and activate the NHS Blocks plugin. Then edit your pages, your new blocks are all homed in a new category called <code>NHS  Frontend Blocks</code> - select any of these and edit away. Variations of the blocks are found in the right hand panel
under <code>Styles</code></p>
<h2>Development Instructions</h2>
<p>To develop your own modifications, you will need to download the full <a href="https://github.com/NHSLeadership/nhsblocks">repo from GitHub</a> - ideally you should be in your <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder.</p>
<ul>
<li>Technical documentation can be found at https://nhsleadership.github.io/nhsblocks/index.html</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have this locally, you will need to change directory to <code>wp-content/plugins/nhsblocks</code>. Start by running <code>npm run install</code> to download and setup all the required node modules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Any changes to styles can be made in the <code>assets/scss</code> folder. To regenerate the css, you will need to run <code>npm run build-scss</code>.</li>
<li>Any changes to the blocks themselves can be made in the <code>src</code> folder. Once changes are complete, you will need to regenerate the js by running <code>npm run build</code>. This will generate new files in the <code>build</code> folder.</li>
<li>If you then wish to export your changes to any other sites, you will need to run <code>npm run zip</code> to regenerate the nhsblocks.zip file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any improvements, bug fixes or amendments should also be submitted back as pull requests to our GitHub repo so that the whole community can benefit from the work.</p>
