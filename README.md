# WordPress Content Blocks: Advanced

This repository houses the native Gutenberg blocks for the Nightingale 2.0 theme from NHS Leadership Academy. At 
present, no css is included with this plugin as it is assumed that you are already running the Nightingale 2.0 theme 
which has all style included.

## Instructions
Download, upload to your `wp-content/plugins` folder in a new folder called `nhsblocks`
