# WordPress Blocks for NHS Theme

This repository houses the native Gutenberg blocks for the Nightingale 2.0 theme from NHS Leadership Academy. At 
present, no css is included with this plugin as it is assumed that you are already running the Nightingale 2.0 theme 
which has all style included.

## Instructions
Download, upload to your `wp-content/plugins` folder in a new folder called `nhsblocks`. Go to your wordpress admin, 
and activate the NHS Blocks plugin. Then edit your pages, your new blocks are all homed in a new category called `NHS
 Frontend Blocks` - select any of these and edit away. Variations of the blocks are found in the right hand panel 
 under `Styles` 

## Credits

components](https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/components)
