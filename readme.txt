NHS styled blocks for WordPress as developed by the NHS Digital Frontend library.

== Description ==

NHS styled blocks for WordPress using the Gutenberg editor, based on the excellent work from the NHSUK Frontend Library. These blocks mean your WordPress site can offer the latest care cards, site promos and info panels to your users, and that all of this content will be styled to match the NHS branding guidelines.

This plugin is designed principally for use by NHS organisations, but can be used by anybody.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. This plugin requires that the Gutenberg plugin (running as a plugin) is already installed and active on your site to get the latest developments and techniques available.
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Navigate to edit or create any page or post.
5. When you go to add a new block to your content, you will see a new section titled "NHS Frontend". In here are all of the new blocks this plugin provides. Experiment - almost all of the blocks have style variations available.
